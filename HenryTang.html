            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <article class="text">
                <p>My name is Henry Tang. I am an Asian American who is currently a student attending Brooklyn College in Brooklyn, New York. The major I am studying for is Computer Science. I am originally come from a small island called Guam, a U.S. Territory, till I moved to New York a couple years back. Self-defined aspects about myself(whether one agrees or not), I tend to value slow-paced process, organization, and detailed oriented approaches.
